# Catstronauts: Mutations

Welcome to the mutations app of Catstronauts ðŸš€! This is a follow up of the previous catstronauts repo and builds up on the code base by implementing **mutations**.

You can [preview the completed demo app here](https://lift-off-client-demo.netlify.app/).

## How to use this repo

The course will walk you step by step on how to implement the features you see in the demo app. This codebase is the starting point of your journey!

There are 2 main folders:

- `server`: The starting point of our GraphQL server.
- `client`: The starting point of our React application.

To get started:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.

This will start the GraphQL API server.

In another Terminal window,

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
